On finding purple links in your search stackoverflow.blogOur 2020 Developer Survey found that when you find that the top link is purple—that is, already clicked—52% of you think, “Hello, old friend.” But another 14% see that purple link with irritation and another 16% see it with amusement. There are basically two things going on here: navigational search and memory imperfections. This article explores some of the research around both of them.\n\n\n\nHow does spam protection work on Stack Exchange? stackoverflow.blogIf you put a textbox on the Internet, someone will put spam in it.
